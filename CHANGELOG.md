## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Fuzzy search, as fzf does it: quick search, the filter of the location menu, and the zoxide
  window find `config.rs` from `cfg`, best match first, with fzf's `'`, `^`, `$`, and `!`.
  On by default; `ui.fuzzy_search = false`, or Fuzzy search in Options → Configuration,
  brings back literal matching.

### Changed

- Release builds use full link-time optimization, which makes the `noc` binary about 6% smaller.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

First release.
